    ### Description
    This project is designed to test the functionality of my CLI README generator.

    &enspThe desire is to provide users with consistent high quality README files for their projects generated right from the command-line by only answering a few questions.

    &enspUnprofessional README files often ruin the hard work a developer has invested in thier repos. The aim of hackMyREADME is to allow developers to quickly and efficiently generate high quality README files so their repos get the recognition they deserve.

    &enspSo many things; using imports instead of require(), exporting work from js files to be envoked in others, utilizing when: in inquirer to only ask questions based on previous user answers, etc.
