## Description
hackMyREADME is a simple CLI README.md generator application.

    The desire is to provide developers with a resource for creating consistent high quality README files for their repos.

    The problem hackMyREADME seeks to resolve is the reality that often times unprofessional README's ruin the hard work a developer has invested in their repo. The aim is to provide a resource to quickly and efficiently generate higher quality README files so the developer can spend more time and energy building their desired application.

    I learned so much developing this application. Everything from exporting js functions to be imported and invoked in other files, to using imports and require(), all the way to effectively utilizing node inquirer. I specifically enjoyed using inquirer's when value to only ask a question dependent on the developers response to a previous question.
