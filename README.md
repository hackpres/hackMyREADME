### Description
This project is designed to test the functionality of my CLI README generator.

    The desire is to provide users with consistent high quality README files for their projects generated right from the command-line by only answering a few questions.

    Unprofessional README files often ruin the hard work a developer has invested into thier repo. My aim is to allow developers to quickly and efficiently generate high quality README files so their repo can get the recognition it deserves.

    So many things; using imports instead of require(), exporting work from js files to be envoked in others, etc.
